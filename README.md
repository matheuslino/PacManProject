> Software developed for academic purposes, as part of the activities of the software engineering discipline.


## About

Implementation of the classic Pacman game in java language. The main objective was to apply the basic principles of object-oriented programming, respecting its rules and paradigms. Some design patterns have been used to make the construction more robust and elegant. 


## concepts and algorithms used

* **Graphs:** Dijkstra's algorithm (for finding the shortest path between two given nodes)
* **Design Patterns:** Singleton (Creational) and Visitor (Behavioral)


## Instructions

* **UML Diagram:** .DIA and .PNG files containing the complete diagram. Located in the **UML folder**
* **Maps:** some maps examples, with a spreadsheet containing a complete tutorial on how to create your own map using a "graphical tool" to help you. All of this can be found in the **Maps folder**
* **Application:** the entire Java application is located in the **Application folder**. You can download it and import it into your personal project if you want.
